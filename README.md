# Simple Ecommerce Product Filtering UI

This project is a vanilla JS product filtering UI which enables the user to filter products on a mock ecommerce site by title and item type. This project allowed provided me with vanilla JS and HTML practice and introduced some core front end concepts such as using the map method to loop over products in a mock API and render on the frontend. This project also provided an introduction to styling using Tailwind CSS.
